# odin-recipes

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops;
I'll visit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

You can find the website at this [Link](https://emacon15.github.io/odin-recipes/)
